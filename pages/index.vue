        <strong>
        With deep regret we realize that psconf.eu 2021 would have just ended, with many friends and colleagues travelling home filled with great memories, passion, new inspiration and ideas.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, the pandemic situation did not allow us to hold <b-link href="https://psconf.eu">psconf.eu</b-link> for the second time in a row. Even though we hope for the best, we don’t know when that will be possible, either. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll keep you updated - but as promised before, starting now, anyone holding a valid psconf.eu voucher can request an automated full refund to the original paying account.
        Alternatively, you can let us know what kind of upcoming services or events you’d like to use the voucher for.</p>

        Please visit the dedicated <b-link href="https://form.jotform.com/201262280123339">refund or reuse website</b-link> to make your choices.
