      <h4>A message from the PowerShell Conference Europe organizers:</h4>
      <p class="text-dark">March 2021</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Firstly, we wish all of our PowerShell friends and colleagues the very best in these different times.
          We hope that everyone is and continues to be safe and well.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to Coronavirus and the limitations that come with it,
        we are sad to have to announce that we will be unable to hold psconf.eu in 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        PowerShell Conference Europe is much more than the sessions,
        we always try to create a joyful, supportive, friendly atmosphere where everyone
        can come together to learn, share, network, and socialize. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It has become obvious to us, that no matter how much we wish for it, 
        neither travelling conditions, legal guidelines, nor broad vaccination will be in a position that would allow us to organize this event in June with the quality and safety that it requires.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that those of you who opted for a voucher need information and a variety of options. We are planning to hold psconf.eu in 2022, anyone with a voucher:
        <ul class="mt-4">
          <li>can use that voucher for 2022 â€“ Nothing for you to do, we will roll the voucher over with some automation ðŸ˜‰</li>
          <li>can be fully reimbursed to the original payment account. (details for requesting this will follow)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we are working on some small-scale events including specialized online classes and possibly a come-together event in fall that you will be able to use the voucher for as well.
        Keep an eye on the usual social media channels for further details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please be a bit patient with us. Weâ€™ll publish all details by end of May. Currently, most of our team members are kept very busy by Corona-related challenges. For example, I temporarily returned to my old profession and work seven days a week as a MD to get as many people vaccinated as possible. Once we can all return to our normal lives, weâ€™ll publish all voucher options on psconf.eu and hopefully also a confirmed date for psconf.eu 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        A year ago, none of us would have thought that Coronavirus could take away two full conference seasons from us (and so many others).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Thank you for your patience and support,<br />
          Tobias and the PowerShell Conference Europe organizers.
